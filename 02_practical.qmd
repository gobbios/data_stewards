# a first repo {background-image="images/phylo.png" background-size="contain"}

<!-- Data source: [Olsen et al 2009](http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/624) -->

## goal
  
- create a repo on a remote server (GitHub)
  
- clone that repo to your local computer as a RStudio project


## a new remote repo

- go to github and create a new repo (+ sign in top right corner)

- fill form, importantly:
  - `public` and initialize with `add readme`

- click `create repository` at bottom

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 150%
knitr::include_graphics("images/gh/newrepo1.png")
```

## 

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 150%
knitr::include_graphics("images/gh/newrepo1.png")
```


## a new remote repo

- get the link (put in the clipboard...)

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/gh/newrepo2.png")
```

## clone to local

- head over to RStudio

- File > New Project...

- Select `Version control` > `Git`
 
- fill the form

- think about the location!!![^irdu45]

- (avoid paths with spaces)


[^irdu45]: I have all git controlled project in "`~/Documents/projects_local`"

## 

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/gh/newrepo3.png")
```

## we did it

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/gh/newrepo4.png")
```


## we did it

- we now have a pristine folder/project that is now under version control

. . .

- RStudio displays the `git` pane (top right)

. . .

- depending on your system setting you will see some hidden files

  - mostly the actual git data base
  
  - RStudio project files

  - ignore these files for now
  

# first steps in our new repo {background-image="images/better-git-it.png" background-size="50%" background-position="bottom right"}

## goal
  
- commit and push a file
  
- make changes to that file, and commit and push again


## commit and push the data file

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- take the data file from Roger

- move it to the project folder

- watch it appear in RStudio's git pane
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/practical/firststeps1.png")
```
:::
:::


## commit and push the data file

- go to the commit dialogue

- select the data file and write a commit message

- and click `commit`

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/practical/firststeps2.png")
```

## commit and push the data file

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

- commit was successful

- (also the top blue line is the actual command to git)

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/practical/firststeps3.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

- data file disappeared from pane

- we are informed that our branch is one commit ahead the remote

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/practical/firststeps4.png")
```
:::
:::

## commit and push the data file

- let's push (the green arrow)

- and verify in the browser whether it worked

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/practical/firststeps5.png")
```


## commit and push changes in the data file

- do some edits to the data file 

  - you can do that in RStudio (or if you must use Calc or Excel)

- I deleted some rows

## commit and push changes in the data file

- watch the file name reappear in the git pane after you saved the edits...

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/practical/firststeps6.png")
```

- the blue `M` indicates that the file was `m`odified since the last commit

- (the yellow `?` indicate that a file was never committed (yet))

## commit and push changes in the data file

- repeat the commit and push procedure from before

- think of a meaningful commit message

- verify on the remote via browser


# congratulations {background-image="images/frodo.jpg" background-size="33%" background-position="right"}

. . .

and a word of caution:

we only scratched the surface

# encore

up to you what's next

keep going:

  - repeat (parts of the) practical
  
  - clone another repo and try to contribute
  
  - talk about .gitignore
  
  - other ideas?
